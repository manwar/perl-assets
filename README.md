# The Perl Logo

## The Repository

### Purpose

The purpose of the `perl-assets` repository is to create a home for a new,
updated Perl logo. One which the Perl communities are free to use and
encouraged to create derivative works from. This logo is hereby released under
CC-BY. We hope that you will take it, use it and make it your own.

### How it's Organized

There are several folders:

- `./base` contains the original camel artwork. This is the camel which is the
  source of the more polished artwork which is found elsewhere. All art in this
  repository is licensed under CC-BY, so you are free to use these images as
  source material.
- `./experimental` contains experiments from which were used in coming up with
  final logo designs.
- `./blessed` contains the "official" logos. If you are designing icons for an
  Operating System, an IDE or need a `favicon.ico`, we would ask you to draw
  from these assets.

### Attribution

If you are working in a medium where you can add an attribution, please link
back to <https://perl.org>.

### Our Attributions

Since we are asking for attribution, it's only fair for us to do the same. The
camel design was created for us by [Zach
Roszczewski](https://www.zachroszczewski.com) and commissioned by Neil Bowers.
The original concepts were iterated upon based on feedback from Neil Bowers,
Babs Veloso and Olaf Alders.

The blessed and experimental logos are the work of Sébastien Feugère.

Feedback on Sébastien Feugère's work was kindly given (in first name

- D Ruth Holloway
- Dallas Hogan
- Graham Knop
- Kenta Kobayashi
- Leo Lapworth
- Makoto Nozaki

## The Backstory

The story of Perl's logo has been well documented. An excellent starting point
is Neil Bowers' blog post from December of 2020:

- [https://neilb.org/2020/12/04/perl-and-camels.html](https://neilb.org/2020/12/04/perl-and-camels.html)

A quick summary of Neil's post is:

### History of the Camel Symbol

- **The Camel**: In 1991, O'Reilly published *Programming Perl*, the first
  major book about the Perl language. Like other O'Reilly books, it featured an
  animal on the cover, and for Perl, it was a camel. This led to a
  long-standing association between camels and Perl.

- **Other Logos**: Over the years, other logos like an onion (connected to
  Larry Wall's "State of the Onion" talks) and a velociraptor were used in some
  contexts, but the camel has remained the most iconic symbol.

### O'Reilly's Position

- Neil B reached out to Tim O'Reilly to clarify the situation, as various
  rumors about O'Reilly’s stance on using the camel logo had circulated.

- **Tim O'Reilly's Statement**: O'Reilly confirmed that Perl cannot use the
  specific camel image from the *Programming Perl* book, but a new camel image
  could be used. The key restriction is that no other publisher can use a camel
  on the cover of a book about Perl, which limits its commercial use.

### A New Camel for Perl

- Neil B suggests that Perl could adopt a new camel logo—separate from the one
  used on O'Reilly's book cover—and use it as the official symbol for the Perl
  language.

- The goal is to create a logo that represents not just the language but also
  the community, one that feels friendly and welcoming.

- Neil B acknowledges that the "camel association" will always be tied to Perl,
  even if a new logo is chosen. He suggests this is a pragmatic approach,
  emphasizing that the restrictions around using camels on books are not a
  major issue.

### Conclusion

Neil advocated for a fresh, community-friendly logo for Perl, while respecting
the historical significance of the camel symbol and acknowledging O'Reilly’s
ownership of the original image. The main takeaway is a call for a new camel
that is free from the constraints of O'Reilly's copyright, to be used as a
symbol for Perl moving forward.

## FAQ

- Will the logos change?

  We currently consider this artwork to be production ready, but also a work in
  progress. We may alter the logos moving forward if we see a need, but we
  don't imagine radical changes to be forthcoming.

- Who put you in charge?

  Nobody. Traditionally things happen in Perl because somebody does something
  and enough other people think it's worth adopting. It's in this spirit that
  the logo is being presented. Our hope is that all (or most) of us can
  standardize on the same artwork. This current working group arose out of a
  conversation at the 2024 Perl Toolchain Summit in Lisbon. We felt we had
  enough stakeholders in the same room to come to an agreement in principle and
  then move ahead with the project.

- Can I Put This on a T-shirt, Mug or Candle?

  Please do! We understand that attribution may not be possible in these
  circumstances. In these cases we would rather you use the logo than worry
  about the attribution aspect of the license. You can be creative as well. If,
  for example, the t-shirts are for a conference, you could add the attribution
  to the conference website. At the end of the day, it's your logo and it's
  your call as to whether you can reasonably add the attribution.
